This includes learners, educators, accrediting bodies, employers, and the community. In Griffith College, we define this as excellence in all aspects of college activities, from learner application for a programme through to graduation from the programme.  \n  Quality Assurance and Enhancement policies and procedures will only be effective if they are supported by all stakeholders. Griffith encourages all learners, academic staff, external examiners, verifiers, partners and employers to engage with the process and foster a culture of quality enhancement at all levels.\xa0  \n    Griffith College Quality Assurance &amp; Enhancement Policies 2022/23    \n    Griffith College Quality Assurance &amp; Enhancement Procedures 2022/23    \n    QAE Manual for Apprenticeships    \n    Griffith College Student Handbook    \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n  \n  \n    \n          Policy Documents  \n      Academic Learner Support Policy    \n    Academic Integrity and Misconduct Procedure    \n    Appeals Form    \n    Appeals Procedure    \n    Complaints Form    \n    Complaints Procedure    \n    Deferrals Procedure    \n    Examination Regulations    \n    Learner Code of Conduct    \n    Learner Disciplinary Procedure    \n    Library User Policy    \n    Recognition of Prior Learning Procedure    \n  \n\n    \n\n\n\n  \n  \n    \n          Our Partnerships  \n  Griffith College works in partnership with a number of validating bodies in Ireland and the UK.
