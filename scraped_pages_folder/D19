This includes learners, educators, accrediting bodies, employers, and the community. In Griffith College, we define this as excellence in all aspects of college activities, from learner application for a programme through to graduation from the programme.   Quality Assurance and Enhancement policies and procedures will only be effective if they are supported by all stakeholders. Griffith encourages all learners, academic staff, external examiners, verifiers, partners and employers to engage with the process and foster a culture of quality enhancement at all levels.     Griffith College Quality Assurance &amp; Enhancement Policies 2022/23     Griffith College Quality Assurance &amp; Enhancement Procedures 2022/23     QAE Manual for Apprenticeships     Griffith College Student Handbook                               Policy Documents     Academic Learner Support Policy     Academic Integrity and Misconduct Procedure     Appeals Form     Appeals Procedure     Complaints Form     Complaints Procedure     Deferrals Procedure     Examination Regulations     Learner Code of Conduct     Learner Disciplinary Procedure     Library User Policy     Recognition of Prior Learning Procedure                                Our Partnerships   Griffith College works in partnership with a number of validating bodies in Ireland and the UK.
