The flexibility of the online material allowed me to balance my studies with working and raising a family, while the small class size in on-campus tutorials fostered a real sense of familiarity with my fellow students and lecturers. I would recommend this course to anybody looking to further their education but hesitant to pursue a degree through the traditional route.  \n\n\n        \n                \n              Nicola Hutchinson\n  \n              Blended BA (Hons) in Business Studies\n  \n          \n            \n    \n\n\n\n  \n  \n  \n        \n        \n  \n  \n            \n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n      \n          \n        \n          It’s the only way I could have earned a degree while still progressing in my career. By the time I finish, I’ll have a level 8 Bachelors in Business and years of experience in a global marketing company. It would have taken me seven years to achieve what I’ve gotten in four.  \n\n\n        \n                \n              Conor Nolan\n  \n              Blended BA (Hons) in Business Studies\n  \n          \n            \n    \n\n\n\n  \n  \n  \n        \n        \n  \n  \n            \n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n      \n          \n        \n          To me studying through blended learning is similar to writing. For the most part, it’s just me and my laptop, there’s no one reminding me to get the work done or of impending deadlines. I think self-motivation, determination, focus and good time management are important when considering studying through blended learning.  \n\n\n        \n                \n              Sara Donohue\n  \n              Blended BA (Hons) in Business Studies\n  \n          \n            \n    \n\n            \n          \n                    \n                \n                \n            \n            \n            \n                    \n  \n\n  \n  \n  \n\n  \n\n  \n        \n  \n      \n  \n        \n        \n          \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n  \n        \n               \n          What\'s new in Griffith  \n              \n        \n        \n      \n  \n\n  \n        \n  \n  \n\n  \n\n  \n        \n  \n      \n  \n        \n\n                \n          \n  \n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n                                                                            \n  \n  \n  \n          Does Blended Learning Work?  \n        \n          \n          \n              \n          \n        \n      \n      \n        Does Blended Learning Work?  \n        Does Blended Learning Work?  \n      \n      \n          Blog    \n        21 November, 2018  \n      \n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n          \n      \n                \n          \n  \n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n                                                                                            \n  \n  \n  \n          Griffith College Receive Award for Best Online Learning Experience at Education Awards 2019\t  \n        \n          \n          \n              \n          \n        \n      \n      \n        Griffith College Receive Award for Best Online Learning Experience at Education Awards 2019\t  \n        Griffith College Receive Award for Best Online Learning Experience at Education Awards 2019\t  \n      \n      \n          News    \n        19 March, 2019  \n      \n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n          \n      \n                \n          \n  \n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\n  \n  \n  \n      \n        Achieve a Balance - Online FE1 Preparation Courses  \n          \n      \n      \n              \n          \n      \n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n          \n      \n      \n  \n\n  \n        \n  \n  \n\n  \n\n  \n  \n      \n  \n        \n        \n          \n          \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n  \n        \n        \n  \n  \n              \n                      \n                    \n\n    \n\n\n\n    \n\n\n      \n      \n            \n          Do you still have questions?  \n        \n                \n            Our Admissions team are available Monday to Friday from 9am to 5:30pm to answer any queries you may have.
