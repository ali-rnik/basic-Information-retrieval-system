The Griffith College Opportunity Scholarship programme has benefited me greatly; without it I would have struggled to afford the cost of College. It has helped open career paths and is something that employers are very impressed by. Being in the scholarship programme also allowed me to create relationships with scholarship winners from other courses. We were all there throughout our degrees to help and support each other.
