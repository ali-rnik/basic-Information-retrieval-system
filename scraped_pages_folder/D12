It is important that the applicant takes this into consideration when applying for the scholarship. The scholarship is means-tested with the aim of providing an opportunity for more students to attend an independent college. Below is some information describing what the scholarship is, how you apply, who is eligible for it, and what courses can be applied for. Please note that courses offered in partnership with Pulse College are not part of this scholarship programme.  \n  In order to be eligible for this scholarship, you must be applying for a college course through the CAO (under the age of 23 years), progressing directly from the Irish Leaving Certificate or a Post-Leaving Certificate Course in Ireland or Northern Ireland. Applications for the Opportunity Scholarship\xa0open on\xa0November 14th 2022.  \n      APPLY HERE      \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n  \n  \n        Important dates  \n    \n              Monday 14th November 2022\xa0    Scholarship Application Form Opens    \n    Friday 21st April 2023\xa0    Scholarship Application Form Closes    \n    Tuesday 2nd May 2023 (TBC)    Scholarship Interviews     \n    Friday 12th May 2023 (TBC)    Successful candidates will be notified     \n  \n\n    \n\n\n\n  \n  \n    \n          Scholarships must be taken in the year in which they are offered.
