Study where you like                                     Busy, geographically dispersed and mature students have more control over their schedules, avoiding the hassle of a daily commute.                                                                                                                                                                                  Support on and off-campus                                     Students experience the personal engagement and support of interacting with their lecturers and classmates while benefiting from the flexibility of online delivery.

The blended nature of the course gave me the best of both worlds. The flexibility of the online material allowed me to balance my studies with working and raising a family, while the small class size in on-campus tutorials fostered a real sense of familiarity with my fellow students and lecturers. I would recommend this course to anybody looking to further their education but hesitant to pursue a degree through the traditional route.                                         Nicola Hutchinson                Blended BA (Hons) in Business Studies                                                                                                                     It’s the only way I could have earned a degree while still progressing in my career. By the time I finish, I’ll have a level 8 Bachelors in Business and years of experience in a global marketing company. It would have taken me seven years to achieve what I’ve gotten in four.                                         Conor Nolan                Blended BA (Hons) in Business Studies                                                                                                                     To me studying through blended learning is similar to writing. For the most part, it’s just me and my laptop, there’s no one reminding me to get the work done or of impending deadlines. I think self-motivation, determination, focus and good time management are important when considering studying through blended learning.
